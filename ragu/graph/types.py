"""
Data structures for representing entities, relations, and communities
within the RAGU knowledge graph system.

These lightweight dataclasses define the core graph components used
throughout the indexing, storage, and retrieval pipelines. Each object
includes an auto-generated hashed ID to ensure consistent deduplication
and reproducibility across sessions.

Modules overview
----------------
• **Entity**, **Relation** — primary units representing semantic nodes
  and edges within the knowledge graph.

• **EntityEmbedding**, **RelationEmbedding** — hold numeric vector
  representations used for embedding-based retrieval and similarity search.

• **Community**, **CommunitySummary** — represent clustered subgraphs
  (communities) and their human-readable summaries produced during
  community detection or summarization.
